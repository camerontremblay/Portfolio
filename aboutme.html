        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a high school student just outside of Raleigh, NC going into my sophmore year of high school.
            I am intersted in a career in computer science and/or web development.
            My goal is to be able to attend UNC after high school, with a major in computer science.
            I am a big sports fan and play baseball. I also like listening to music and playing video games.

        <p>I believe that life isn't always about the destination, but how you get there.
            It is just as important to enjoy the smaller moments in your life as well as the bigger ones.
            Think about your favorite memories. 
            Are they all from one, large, planned moment or are they spread out randomly through your life?
            Of course those big vacations and ceremonies mean a lot, but so do all those random events that make you happy.
