        <h1>Freshman Year</h1>
        <p>Freshman year was a big year for me, as I had to adjust to the high school setting.
            However, I was up to the challenge. I passed every single class with an A and completed my first AP class.
            Unfortunately, I did not get involved in any clubs due to personal issues, but I still was able to make friends and enjoy myself.
        </p>
        <p>Check out the classes I took below. 
            Each class will have a description, my grade, and any other important details.
        </p>

        <p>At the end of my freshman year I realized a few things.
            First off, I realized that I can do well in my high school classes if I put the work in.
            I also realized that I needed to get involved in at least 1 club that consistently meets.
            Overall, I consider my freshman year a success, but wish I had done more socially.
